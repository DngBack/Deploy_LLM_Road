# Experiment Tracking & Model Management

Experiment tracking is the process of recording and managing all aspects of machine learning experiments, including hyperparameters, model performance, datasets, and system metrics. It ensures reproducibility, allows easy comparison of different runs, and helps identify the best configurations for fine-tuning models. Tools like Comet provide real-time logging, visualization, and collaboration features, making it easier to track progress and optimize model performance efficiently.
